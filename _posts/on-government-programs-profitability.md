## On the profitability of government programs

Can we really say that a specific program is losing money ? Yes
Is it relevant considering the fact that every government endeavor is funded by a mix of direct payments and subsidies ? No

The reason is that the pricing of those things is simply political.
Every government program receives subsidies. There is no such thing a profitability for a government service.

The government budget can be in deficit or in surplus, it doesn't mean that the government profits to society.
It simply means that it survives within its means, it's a good indication of efficiency but nothing more. It doesn't mean the services it supplies are useful, or that they would survive in a market economy. Because they simply exists for popular reasons and the direct prices of these services are elaborated for political reasons aswell, the subsidies come and complement the rest of the costs. Such a practice distorts the real demand for this service and this mix of private contribution and subsidies make it impossible to say whether that service would survive as a private endeavor. Because again the prices are kept down for political reasons.

If a government service is unprofitable, it implies it will receives subsidies but not everything that receives subsidies can be considered unprofitable. Again, it might just be that a politician want to hide the real costs and therefore relies on more subsidies than consumer contribution to hide things. This fact makes talking about government profitability pointless.
