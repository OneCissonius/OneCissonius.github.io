## Culture is everything (Culture & technology?)

Economics, scientific process, logic all these processes and what works in them are mostly understood. 
Prices should not be interfered with. Trust data not scientists. Trust argument chains not things that sound good.

Thing is democracies don't have the incentives to do good economics. Government labs don't have incentives to do good science. People don't have incentives to argue.

The only reason the USA has free speech is not because the constitution binds people, but because it stems from people with a certain culture who wanted to spread that culture. America has free speech because people hold free speech as an important value of their lives and society and it gets reinforced by seeing europeans (canada included) jailing people for insulting politicians.

The hard part is changing culture. It's to notice how culture changes and then act to change it. 

- Technology enables freedom and changes culture
- Influential people and the book they read and the friends they make changes culture
- The fight between masses imposing socialist culture through democracy and influential people fighting for pro-market legislation and the ones fighting for more feudalism. (it's a triangle)
