## We need technology

I don't view the word "democracy" in any good light. Controlling "hate" speech or words of illegal activities are very popular in Europe. 

Democracy does not imply freedom, never has, never will. 

Democracies reflect the culture of different people who have power over the government for various reasons.
- Laws emerge from either popularity (gotta secure vote), 
- self preservation : securing more power for the government
- or lobbies: gotta get rich at some point

None of the pillars of the Democracy guarantee the protections of freedoms only culture does. However, you can still structure a society that promotes those.

One of the reasons government spendings are wacky is because they spend for popular reasons and because people don't feel the repercussions of their decisions, you can fix this by making things more decentralising at a very small scale (i.e. city). It's easy to compete with other states, moving between countries is a hard thing to do. Competition between cities would bring more benefits however, it simply is easier to move and reject laws there and go the next town who shares the same culture on all but some specific points.
