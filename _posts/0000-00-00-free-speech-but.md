## Free speech is absolute fucking morons 

talk about:
- government shouldn't control speech (historic of jail time for insulting politicians)
- morally wrong because people self censor

"We should restrict your movement and takeaway money from you for the words you said." That sounds fucking retarded. Let's examine why.





The real arguments are something like this:


- You're threatening to do something bad yourself and that alone warrants punishment.




- You can influence people to do things.

this is the hardest question honestly -->
Let's examine the difference between a mafia boss who tells his minion to go and murder someone, and someone on twitter who says to do some illegal shit. 

The difference is that a mafia boss uses a man like tool and the man uses a gun like a tool. but the one who inspires people to commit crimes doesn't have leverage over them and is free of guilt because the perpetrators are doing their deeds with full freedom. the mafia boss probably handles his organisation by having leverage over his most immediate commanders whihc themselves have leverage over their pawn etc. But the pawn isn't free of charge either, it's more like they all become guilty. Unless they're fully doing so because the boss has their family hostage.

Inspiring is always indirect, you can't punish that. I think it comes back to if there is an agreement / an organisation, any form of it, a contract, that binds the executor to the order giver in some aspect. This is the hard part to argue and distinguish.

read legislature, especially US, to understand case by case and figure out if there is something to generalize : https://www.google.com/search?q=is+someone+who+gives+orders+to+kill+guilty&rlz=1C1CHBD_frFR1003FR1003&oq=is+someone+who+gives+orders+to+kill+guilty+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRhA0gEKMTAxNjdqMGoxNagCCLACAQ&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
